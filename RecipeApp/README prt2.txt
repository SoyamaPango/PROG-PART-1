Instructions for how to run and compile a software

Start your IDE (Integrated Development Environment): Open your IDE, be it JetBrains Rider, Visual Studio, or another one.

Launch Your Initiative: Locate your project in the directory and launch it in your integrated development environment.

Examine the organisation of your project to make sure all required files—such as your Program.cs file and other class files—are present and arranged correctly.

Compile Your Project: Locate the build or compile option in your IDE. Typically, this is found in the menu bar among choices like "Build" and "Compile." To complete your project, click on it. This procedure creates the executable file and fixes any mistakes in your code.

Launch Your Programme: Using the "Run" menu in your IDE, you can launch your project after it has successfully compiled. Your programme will run as a result, and the output should appear in the console window.

Interact with Your Programme: You might need to enter data or perform other interactions with your programme, depending on its functionality. To achieve this, adhere to the prompts or guidelines that your programme provides.

Debugging (if required): You might need to debug your programme if you run into any unexpected behaviour or issues. The majority of IDEs come with debugging tools that let you go line by line through your code, check the values of variables, and find problems.

Make modifications (if Necessary): You can make modifications to your code in your IDE and then go through the compilation and execution phases again if you find any problems or wish to add new features to your programme.

Save Your Changes: To protect your work, make sure to save your files in your IDE as soon as you're happy with the modifications you've made.

When you're done working on your project, you can close your integrated development environment (IDE).

Feedback 

My lecture could not mark my part 1 because i did not upload my project correctly.To improve for Part 2, i  reviewed that feedback carefully and made the necessary changes. I focused on ensuring that i follow the correct file upload procedure this time. I did that by asking other IOS users how they ziped their files and by emailing my lecture as well.
