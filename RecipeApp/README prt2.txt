Instructions for how to run and compile a software

Start your IDE (Integrated Development Environment): Open your IDE, be it JetBrains Rider, Visual Studio, or another one.

Launch Your Initiative: Locate your project in the directory and launch it in your integrated development environment.

Examine the organisation of your project to make sure all required files—such as your Program.cs file and other class files—are present and arranged correctly.

Compile Your Project: Locate the build or compile option in your IDE. Typically, this is found in the menu bar among choices like "Build" and "Compile." To complete your project, click on it. This procedure creates the executable file and fixes any mistakes in your code.

Launch Your Programme: Using the "Run" menu in your IDE, you can launch your project after it has successfully compiled. Your programme will run as a result, and the output should appear in the console window.

Interact with Your Programme: You might need to enter data or perform other interactions with your programme, depending on its functionality. To achieve this, adhere to the prompts or guidelines that your programme provides.

Debugging (if required): You might need to debug your programme if you run into any unexpected behaviour or issues. The majority of IDEs come with debugging tools that let you go line by line through your code, check the values of variables, and find problems.

Make modifications (if Necessary): You can make modifications to your code in your IDE and then go through the compilation and execution phases again if you find any problems or wish to add new features to your programme.

Save Your Changes: To protect your work, make sure to save your files in your IDE as soon as you're happy with the modifications you've made.

When you're done working on your project, you can close your integrated development environment (IDE)

How to run the application
Enter Recipe Details (Option 1):
By choosing this option, you can enter a recipe's details.
First, you will enter the recipe's name.
After that, you'll input how many ingredients the recipe calls for.
You'll list the name, amount, calories, food group, and unit of measurement for each ingredient.
The number of steps needed to prepare the recipe will then need to be entered, and then each step itself.
Once all the information has been entered, the app will show a confirmation message and warn you if the recipe's total calories are more than 300.

Display Recipe List (Option 2):
This option shows you a list of every recipe you've submitted so far, arranged by name and alphabetically.
You can view all of your recipes at once by using this list.


Display Recipe by Name (Option 3):

By choosing this option, you can input the name of a recipe and examine its information.
The recipe's components, preparation instructions, and total calories will be shown, if it is available.
A notification stating that the recipe could not be found will appear if it doesn't exist.

Exit (Option 4):
Choosing this option will exit the Recipe App.

Feedback 

My lecture could not mark my part 1 because i did not upload my project correctly.To improve for Part 2, i  reviewed that feedback carefully and made the necessary changes. I focused on ensuring that i follow the correct file upload procedure this time. I did that by asking other IOS users how they ziped their files and by emailing my lecture as well. My lecture also advised me to include the steps on the running app and to guide the user through them. In this part i have  made sure i guide the user and provide the steps to run the app.
